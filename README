Amendment to Gatherer Count on Resources


Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------
There was some discussion some time ago about short comings in the
current Gatherer count on resources, and how it was possible, for
example, for a player to assign units to a resource and, even if that
resource was half-way across the map, no other player would be able to
gather at that resource. (Some of this discussion can be found at
http://wildfiregames.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=17461. Also see
issues #643, #1387 and #1871)

Several possible solutions were given, from removing gatherer limits
entirely, to making the limits be player-specific, to some complex
solution involving hard/soft limits and/or distance. As far as I am
aware, the solution used in this mod is not something that has been
proposed or considered yet.

This solution retains the global `Gatherer` list of each`ResourceSupply`,
but also adds a player-specific `EnrouteGatherer` list.  When a unit is
tasked to gather, they are added to their owner's `EnrouteGatherer` list
for the given resource. Upon arrival, they are then transferred to the
globally shared `Gatherer` list. Later, when a `IsAvailable()` check is
made by a player on the resource, the global `Gatherer` list is added to
the querying player's `EnrouteGatherer` list and a count made that takes
into account units belonging to all players that are currently at the
resource and gathering, and any units belonging to the player in
question that are currently enroute to the resource.

The `EnrouteGatherer`s of Mutual Allies is not taken into account, but
this could be achieved if desired.


Demonstrative Example
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Players 1 and 2 are both able to see a given tree. No-one is currently
  gathering from this tree.
* Player sends four units to gather from the tree. These units are now
  "en-route".
* Player 1 selects the tree, and sees that four of the eight gather
  slots on the tree are filled.
* Player 2 selects the tree, and sees that none of the gather slots are
  filled, which makes sense as a player should not have advance notice
  (by default) of enemy unit movements.
* Player 1's units arrive and set to work. Player 2's UI updates itself
  and shows that four of the tree's gather slots are now filled.

Player 2 could only see that Player 1's units were assigned to the tree
when they got there. Until then, as far as she knew, the tree was still
free. Thus, a player does not have advance warning of enemy units on the
way to gather.

* Player 1 sends four more units to the same tree. According to his UI,
  all the tree's gather slots are now occupied.
* Player 2, whose UI still only shows four slots filled, sends her own
  four units to gather. Her UI now also shows that all the tree's gather
  slots are filled.
* Player 2's units arrive first, and set to work. Player 1's units
  arrive moments later, find the tree full and look for a nearby tree to
  gather from instead.

Although Player 1 sent his units to gather first, Player 2's units
arrived first and thus took precedance when it came to assigning
available gather slots. Thus, a player cannot remote-block another
player's access to a resource by assigning to gather from a distance.
